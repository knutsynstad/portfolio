    <p>
      In this visualization, we examine what Herbert Simon might call the
      &#8220;solution space&#8221; for tic-tac-toe, a compound visualization of
      all its solutions&mdash;every legal game move and the connections between
      them&mdash;in a single artifact.
    </p>
    <p>
      How large is the solution space? Well, for the first move, there are 9
      cells available. For the second, there are 8, and so on. Follow to
      completion, and we get{" "}
      <Code>
        9&times;8&times;7&times;6&times;5&times;4&times;3&times;2&times;1
      </Code>{" "}
      or <Code>9!</Code> boards for the final level. For each level{" "}
      <Code>n</Code> of gameplay, there are <Code>9!/(9-n)!</Code> boards in
      total. By adding the level totals together, we get an &#8220;upper
      bound&#8221; of 986,410 boards&mdash;far too many to represent
      meaningfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the visualization to be meaningful, the number of boards must be
      reduced. We do this by introducing 3 rules; (1) removing duplicate boards
      reduces the count to 6,046, (2) removing illegal moves (play after a win)
      reduces the count to 5,478, and (3) by removing symmetric duplicates
      (rotational and reflectional) we are left with 765 unique boards. This
      poster displays them all in a matrix.
