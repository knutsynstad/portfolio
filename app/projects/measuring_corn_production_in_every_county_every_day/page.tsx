      Every year, the{" "}
      <a href="https://www.usda.gov/">
        United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
      </a>{" "}
      spends millions of dollars predicting national crop production throughout
      the growing season. Helped by thousands, they sample farms, by hand, in a
      portion of the 3,242 counties. Their monthly reports move commodity crop
      marketsâ€”having this information before others provide a significant
      advantage.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2015, <a href="http://descarteslabs.com/">Descartes Labs</a> used
      public satellites, weather data, and their expertise in distributed
      supercomputing to make the first entirely automated forecast of national
      corn production. While the USDA reports at a state and national
      granularity, Descartes Labs can provide per county predictions. Their
      prediction came within 1.9% of the actual production, reported by the USDA
      more than 6 months later.
    </p>

    <p>
      This poster was made to better understand key aspects of corn growth and
      prediction. It visualizes the 2015 growing season in Polk County, Iowa,
      and is one of a series. New posters, showing conditions for other
      counties, can be produced programmatically.
