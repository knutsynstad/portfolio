    <p>
      Most of us are familiar with the notion that a complex idea may be
      communicated through an image, or that an image of an object captures its
      meaning or essence better than a description could. Iconography is a
      natural extension of this notion. Space efficient and inherently
      multilingual, it lends itself to a range of communication tasksâ€”from
      wayfinding on public transit to digital interfaces.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following line icons have a uniform size and were drawn with a single
      stroke weight, round caps, and corners, on a padded 8 by 8 grid. Use of
      color is limited to a solid color and a derivative tint as needed.
    </p>
